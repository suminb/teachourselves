    Teach Ourselves uses a Facebook application to engage youth in earning rewards by creating, sharing, and solving problems about science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) topics. The ultimate goal is to improve STEM knowledge and inspire more individuals to pursue STEM careers.

<h3>What does a Teach Ourselves Scholar do?</h3>
<p>
    Use the Facebook application to solve and write problems to support improving STEM knolwedge while earning points that can be redeemed for rewards. Scholars are assigned a mentor who approves the problems. All interaction between scholars and mentors is monitored.
</p>
<p>
    Scholars create complete, accurate and appropriate problems. Each problem that is approved can then be sold for publication. Selling for publication earns the scholar points that can be redeemed for a gift certificate from iTunes or Amazon (during the pilot).

<h3>First, a short pilot</h3>
<p>
    Starting May 2011, the pilot will test the basics of the Facebook application allowing mentors and high school-aged scholars to discuss original problems ; verify the work-flow from a scholar writing a problem, discussing with the group, submitting to the mentor for approval, to publication and sharing of the problem; and determine patterns in solving other published problems.
