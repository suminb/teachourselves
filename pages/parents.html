    The Teach Ourselves (TO) Facebook application allows youth to connect with each other and science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) mentors to build science and math knowledge while earning real rewards.

<h3>Why Facebook?</h3>
<p>
    Facebook is an established social network that a vast majority of youth, ages 13+, access regularly. There are many games and applications hosted within Facebook, but few that offer the opportunity to gain academic knowledge while earning real rewards in preparation for a future STEM profession.
